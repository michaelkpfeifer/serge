The purpose of this repository is to help me understand how the [Gleam
compiler](https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam) works.

Obviously, it is heavily influenced by the Gleam compiler. I try not
to copy Gleam source code directly, but I believe that this still is
"derivative work" of the Gleam compiler.

The Gleam compiler is licensed under the [Apache
License](https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/blob/main/LICENCE).

The current project is also licensed under the Apache License.
