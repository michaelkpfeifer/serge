The purpose of this repository is to help me get a basic understanding
of how to write a compiler in Rust. It is heavily influenced by the
[Gleam compiler](https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam).

The Gleam compiler and the current project are both licesed under the
[Apache
License](https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/blob/main/LICENCE).
